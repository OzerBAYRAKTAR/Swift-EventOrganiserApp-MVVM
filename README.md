# Built With 🛠
* StoryBoard => Storyboards are an exciting feature first introduced in iOS 5, which save time building user interfaces for your apps. Storyboards allow you to prototype and design multiple view controller views within one file, and also let you create transitions between view controllers.
* CoreData => Framework used to manage the model layer objects in the application.

* Figma => Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based.

* MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls.

* Coordinator Pattern => Using the coordinator pattern in iOS apps lets us remove the job of app navigation from our view controllers, helping make them more manageable and more reusable, while also letting us adjust our app's flow whenever we need.
